# Semantic Information Retrieval Engine  

This project implements a **scalable semantic search engine** that combines **classical Information Retrieval (IR)** techniques with **modern neural retrieval methods**. The system is capable of efficiently searching over large document collections by integrating **sparse retrieval (TF-IDF, BM25)** with **dense retrieval (Sentence-BERT + FAISS)**, and finally merging results through a **hybrid pipeline** for improved ranking quality.  

The implementation is based on standard IR principles and neural embedding models, making it suitable both as a **research prototype** and as a **demonstration project** for real-world document retrieval tasks.
